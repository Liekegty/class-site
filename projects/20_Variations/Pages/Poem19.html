    <p> Chaos | by Stanley Moss (2017) </p>

    There are places for chaos on the <span id="any"> page, </span>
<br>meaningful, apparent <br>
confusion — temps en temps on the continent
<br>does not mean “time to time” in Kent,<br>
Greenwich.</span> From stone through weeds and parchment,
<br>through bad times, words made their way to the printed page.<br>
Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage,
<br>but for those who pray with bare feet,<br>
some washed, some <span id="any">smelling</span> of stables and excrement.
</span>
</p>

<p>I’m not sure the <span id="any">words</span> ocean and sea
<br>mean the same to you and me.<br>
Ninety-five percent universal confusion,
<br>dark matter was born with the legitimacy<br>
of an onion, the <span id="any">roar</span> of a lion.
<br>I sit in the rumble seat of judgment,<br>
I <span id="any">damn</span> myself for entertainment,
<br>for wasting time on hopeless entertainment.<br>
I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian
<br>knots in my <span id="any">“Shakespeare”</span> fishing reels.<br>
I must untangle this because eels
<br>have hearts like us. The enemy<br>
is symmetry.
<br>In the spring of content,<br>
I trust <span id="any">glorious</span> chaos. I smell in disorder
the outhouse of order.</p>

<p>I <span id="any">must</span> have respect for what I kill and eat,
<br>Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat.<br>
He added, “Waste nothing you <span id="any">eat,</span>”
<br>he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me,<br>
or my Father, <span id="any">one</span> person who is three.”
<br>Rebecca, at the well,<br>
said, “Drink. Water your camels.”
<br>I swear, my hands each on a Bible,<br>
the only <span id="any">evidence</span> admissible is invisible.
<br>At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell.<br></p>

<p><span id="any">Chaos</span> is not a “sometime thing,”<br>
its face and back are turned to and from us,
<br>what I cannot see is <span id="any">beautiful,</span> or an isthmus<br>
that connects almost nothing to almost nothing — 
<br>the great unless, either/or.<br>
I grab on to metaphor,
<br>uncertainty, dark matter, gravity <span id="any">specific.</span><br>
The motto I nail to my door:
<br>The Devil generalizes, angels are specific.<br>
Chaos makes me merry,
<br>string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory,<br>
romance of the <span id="any">rose,</span>
<br>roses that go with any other flower,<br>
from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry.
<br>From fertile <span id="any">Chaos</span> sprang Eros and Night:<br>
Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night.
<br>Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour.<br>
I model for myself, I pose in north <span id="any">light.</span></p>

<p>With helpers, his stevedore brothers, Hypnos
<br>and Thanatos, Charon still poles his <span id="any">familiar</span> ferry<br>
across the Styx to an island where skeletons dance.
<br>Einstein said, “I too believe in appearance,”<br>
he didn’t think <span id="any">Old One</span> plays dice, takes chances.
<br>You bet your bottom dollar the universe<br>
rhymes with another universe like verse.
<br>Yeats, <span id="any">Herrick,</span> and Herbert would like that.<br>
To them, I lift my hat.
<br>Delphic chaos is wise,<br>
metaphoric thinking multiplies
<br>bunches of grapes, by tripod, by butterflies.<br>
Chaos is endless longing — 
<br><span id="any">God’s</span> pussycat.<br>
In Prague, Mozart knew a starling
<br>who sang his piano concerto all along,<br>
except for one note he always got <span id="any">wrong.</span></p>
