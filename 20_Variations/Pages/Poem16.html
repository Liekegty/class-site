    <p> Chaos | by Stanley Moss (2017) </p>

    <p>There are places for chaos on the <div id="rotate" <div class="centered">page,</div>
<br>meaningful, apparent<br>
confusion — temps en temps on<br> the continent
<br>does not mean “time to time” in <div class="centered">Kent,</div><br>
or Greenwich. From stone through <br>weeds and parchment,
<br>through bad times, words made <br>their way to the printed page.<br>
Bibles now not just for those who <br>go to worship by <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">carriage,</div>
<br>but for those who pray with <br>bare feet,
some washed, some <br>smelling of stables<br> and <br><div class="centered">excrement.</div>

<p>I’m not sure the words ocean and sea
<br>mean the same to you and me.<br>
Ninety-five percent universal confusion,
<br>dark matter was born with the <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">legitimacy</div><br>
of an onion, the roar of a lion.
<br>I sit in the rumble seat of judgment,<br>
I damn myself for entertainment,<br>
for wasting time on hopeless <br>entertainment.
I am guilty of <br>snarling lines, Gordian
<br>knots in my “Shakespeare” <div class="centered">fishing reels.</div><br>
I must untangle this because eels
<br>have hearts like us. The enemy<br>
is symmetry.
<br>In the spring of content,<br>
I trust glorious chaos. I smell in <br>disorder
the outhouse of order.

<br>I must have respect for what I kill <br>and eat,
Jesus gave them <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">loaves</div><br> and fishes, not meat.<br>
He added, “Waste nothing you eat,”
<br>he did not say, “Waste is chaos <br>made by me,
or my Father, one <br>person who is three.”
<br>Rebecca, at the well,<br>
said, “Drink. Water your camels.”
<br>I swear, my hands each on a <div class="centered">Bible,</div><br>
the only evidence admissible is <br>invisible.
<br>At twenty, I was lost in the <br>snow, a sleigh bell.<br>

Chaos is not a “sometime thing,”<br>
its face and back are turned to and<br> from us,
what I cannot see <br>is beautiful, or an <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">isthmus</div><br>
that connects almost nothing to <br>almost nothing — 
the great unless<br>, either/or.
I grab on to metaphor,
<br>uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific.<br>
The motto I nail to my door:
<br>The Devil generalizes, angels are <div class="centered">specific.</div><br>
Chaos makes me merry,
<br>string or rose-by-any-other-rose <br>theory,
romance of the rose,
<br>roses that go with any other flower,<br>
from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry.
<br>From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night:<br>
Chaos danced first with<br> Eros, then jealous <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">Night</div>.
<br>Time carries a scythe, women and <br>men sound the hour.<br>
I model for myself, I pose in north light.<br>With helpers, his stevedore brothers, <br>Hypnos
and Thanatos, Charon <br>still poles his familiar ferry<br>
across the Styx to <br>an island where skeletons <div class="centered">dance.</div>
<br>Einstein said, “I too believe <br>in appearance,”
he didn’t think <br>Old One plays dice, takes chances.
<br>You bet your bottom dollar the universe<br>
rhymes with another universe like verse.
<br>Yeats, Herrick, and Herbert would <br>like that.<br>
To them, I lift my <div id="rotate"<div class="centered">hat</div>.
<br>Delphic chaos is wise,<br>
metaphoric thinking multiplies
<br>bunches of grapes, by tripod, by <br>butterflies.
Chaos is endless longing — 
<br>God’s pussycat.<br>
In Prague, Mozart knew a starling
<br>who sang his piano concerto all along,<br>
except for one note he always got <div class="centered">wrong.</div></p>
