    <br> 
    <p>There are places for chaos on the page,
    	 <br>
    <br> 
     <br>
    <br> 
     <br>
<br>meaningful, apparent<br>
 <br>
    <br> 
     <br>
    <br> 
confusion — temps en temps on the continent
 <br>
    <br> 
     <br>
<br>does not mean “time to time” in  <br>
    <br> Kent,<br>  <br>
  
or Greenwich. From stone through weeds and parchment,<br>
    <br> 
<br>through bad times, words made their way to the printed page.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
   
Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage,<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>but for those who pray with bare feet,<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
some washed, some smelling of stables and excrement.

<p>I’m not sure the words ocean and sea
<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>mean the same to you and me.<br>
Ninety-five percent universal confusion,
<br>dark matter was born with the legitimacy<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
of an onion, the roar of a lion.
<br>I sit in the rumble seat of judgment,<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
I damn myself for entertainment,
<br>for wasting time on hopeless entertainment.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian
<br>knots in my “Shakespeare” fishing reels.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
I must untangle this because eels
<br>have hearts like us. The enemy<br>
is symmetry.<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>In the spring of content,<br>
I trust glorious chaos. I smell in disorder
the outhouse of order.</p>
<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<p>I must have respect for what I kill and eat,
<br>Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
He added, “Waste nothing you eat,”
<br>he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me,<br><br>
    <br> 
or my Father, one person who is three.”
<br>Rebecca, at the well,<br><br>
    <br> 
said, “Drink. Water your camels.”
<br>I swear, my hands each on a Bible,<br>
the only evidence admissible is invisible.
<br>At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell.<br></p>

<p>Chaos is not a “sometime thing,”<br>
its face and back are turned to and from us,<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>what I cannot see is beautiful, or an isthmus<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
that connects almost nothing to almost nothing — 
<br>the great unless, either/or.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
I grab on to metaphor,
<br>uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
The motto I nail to my door:
<br>The Devil generalizes, angels are specific.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
Chaos makes me merry,
<br>string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory,<br>
romance of the rose,
<br>roses that go with any other flower,<br>
from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry.
<br>From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night:<br>
Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night.
<br>Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour.<br>
I model for myself, I pose in north light.</p>

<p>With helpers, his stevedore brothers, Hypnos<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>and Thanatos, Charon still poles his familiar ferry<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
across the Styx to an island where <br>
    <br> skeletons dance.<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>Einstein said, “I too believe in appearance,”<br>
he didn’t think Old One plays dice, <br>
    <br> takes chances.<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>You bet your bottom dollar the <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> universe<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
rhymes with another universe like verse.<br>
    <br> 
<br>Yeats, Herrick, and Herbert would like that.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
To them, I lift my hat.<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>Delphic chaos is wise,<br>
metaphoric thinking multiplies<br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
<br>bunches of grapes, by tripod, by butterflies.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
Chaos is endless longing — 
<br>God’s pussycat.<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
In Prague, Mozart knew a starling
<br>who sang his piano concerto all along,<br><br>
    <br> <br>
    <br> 
except for one note he always got wrong.</p>
